# ‚ô•Ô∏è @blakedebray's Human User Guide 

üëã Hello there! This is a great place to learn more about how I like to interact with, and show up for others. Think of this as the current version of how I do so. I am always learning and changing, so expect to see changes over time. 

If you see something that is missing about me from your perspective, I would love to hear it!

## üë§ About me

You can learn more about my values, what motivates me, and more in the [README](./README.md) about...me.

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?
- I am an introvert, but often considered a social one. I tend to take some time to feel safe to participate in new social situations and with new people but once I feel comfortable I might need some encouragement to shut up üòÑ. I need time away from people to recharge. For example, workshops and collaboration spaces are a blast, but I am exhausted afterwards. 
- I love self reflection and believe in a better understanding myself in order to better understand how to help others.
- I love to learn.
- I used to be a "follow the rules" kind of coach. Now I am far more pragmatic and practices/tools agnostic. Instead of "process", I am more about "helping humans help other humans" (or finding the right practices to best do the "how" with a deep understanding of the "why").
	
### What drives you nuts?
- Excluding people. I value inclusion and there might be times where I am overly sensitive when not everyone is invited to participate and be heard.
- An environment that enforces a strong power gradient. Also related to exclusion/inclusion and trust, but spaces where the hierarchy overrides collaboration and safety.
- Too much WIP!!! Too much work-in-progress and context switching stresses me out. I love spreading the good word of healthy WIP and flow (should be a band name).
- Being voluntold for things when there is no WHY or context. Help me understand the need and how it will help people.
- Traffic. My dad superpowers are growing stronger, so also people who drive too fast. Pharmaceutical commercials.

### What are your quirks?
- Like a faulty smoke detector, I have an overly sensitive "trust" alarm. Sometimes I might view something as a violation of trust before others or, more likely, when it isn't even there.
- I tend to fall into the mindtrap of filling in the gaps with simple stories; mostly about worst case scenarios that others are (but probably not) thinking about me. If I end up in this state, it can consume my thoughts until I resolve it. I can handle honest and direct feedback but it is what is unsaid that I struggle with.
- I organize via disorganization (don't look at my desk!); strange for someone who often helps others plan.
- I often respond by asking questions. It is a part of my love for learning, my frustration for when I am missing the context, and my coaching background.
- I am not great and awkward at small talk; I would rather get into a topic deeply with others.

### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?
- I often share ideas before I vett/filter them myself (if I feel safe in doing so). I will often change my mind or retract something I share later. 
- Silence doesn't mean lack of interest. I need to listen and digest before sharing ideas. However, if I don't feel safe yet I might hesitate speaking up.
- I am primarily driven by my emotions (with a healthy splash of logical thinking); but my emotions don't always show up in my facial expressions.

### How do you deal with stress?
- I do not like stressful situations that are needlessly so; and will not respond as well in such situations.
- Am a contradiction: I need time alone while also sharing with someone else for processing.
- I take a long time to process stressful situations, and they sit with me for a long time. There is a risk of it becoming something I dwell on if I don't move towards action/resolution.
- I typically seek coaching (more so than advice).
- I disconnect, find an activity to temporarily take my mind off things.
- I reconnect with Nature.

## üë• About my colleagues

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?
- **I love collaboration and working as a team.** A team that defaults to working together to share ideas and learn from each other is where I thrive. Working in a silo or alone makes me uncomfortable.
- Honesty with kindness; and kindness to each other when we are being vulnerable (no quick reaction of judging or defending).
- Being our true selves with all of our quirks and superpowers. A team that welcomes everyone.
- Expression through emojis and GIFs (also, I don't care how you pronounce it).

### What do you wish colleagues didn‚Äôt do?
- Play politics; or the not pleasant kind like backstabbing or plotting against others. I am a peacemaker and prefer to work towards a common goal together.
- Use power over collaboration or influence. "Let's find out together" instead of "because I said so".
- Assume I know or have the context (terminology, acronyms, history, etc). I will do my best and speak up when I am missing something, but when I have spent my daily extrovert points I might hesistate.

### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
- Based on my themes from above: include others, share and learn openly, create a safe and trusting space for collaboration.
- Collaborate on ideas over invididualism/heroism.
- Co-create, share ideas, look at work as shared play.
- Be vulnerable.
- Talk about nerdy stuff (I love all things Sci-Fi, Fantasy, books, video games, tabletop games, etc).

## üìë About my interactions

### How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?
- Be curious and be present.
- Actively listen. In a lot of cases, people just need someone to listen. They will often answer their own questions/problems. I have been guilty of feeding the "advice monster" too quickly.
- Lead with empathy. Understand and respect their perspective and offer alternatives.
- Be intentional and transparent about the stances you are taking. If the right thing is to teach/advise/mentor/coach, let them know (or better yet, ask for permission).
- Be willing to be coached as well.
- Approach work as a learning problem. Experiment and learn.
	
### What‚Äôs the best way to communicate with you?
- I like starting with chat (slack), but with my tendancy to create simple stories on any misunderstandings/misinterpretations in written communication, I will eventually need real-time (zoom) conversations if necessary.
- Even as an introvert, I sometimes crave the real-time conversations just to connect with other humans.
	
### What‚Äôs the best way to convince you to do something?
- My "how do I coach others" list applies to me as well.
- Start with the "why" and I will likely be on board.
- Ask for me to participate in thoughts, ideas and giving feedback.
- Create a space of high psychological safety, where it is safe to ask questions, to not have all of the answers, and to try something new.
	 
### How do you like to give feedback?
- In a real-time conversations. My "fill in the gaps" quirk would kick in if I sent it in slack. I would fear that any feedback would be misinterpreted.

### How do you like to get feedback?
- Similar to how I prefer to offer feedback with others. In real-time chat.
- Give me honest feedback with kindness.
- Use tools such as SBI and Non-Violent Communication (or Compassionate Communication if you prefer). I want to understand the impact an action or my behavior has created (good or bad).
