# :bust_in_silhouette: About Me

:wave: Hello there!

My name is Blake. I am a Program Manager, practicing Professional Coach, an experienced Agile Coach, and a former Engineer (once upon a time).

This space is a way to get to know more about me: what gives me purpose, what motivates me, my experiences, and my philosophy on things from coaching to organizational development. 

If you want to get in touch to connect, discuss _anything_, or collaborate, you can message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blakedebray/)!

If you want to learn how my values, strengths, and weaknesses come into play with how I interact with others? Check out my [Human User Guide](./human-user-guide.md).

## :compass: My Purpose and Aspirations
To positively impact and enable the lives of others (and the world) by supporting them to discover the next best version of themselves.

## :sparkling_heart: My Values

### Authenticity
I believe it is important to be myself and not try to be something that I am not. I believe in sharing openly (with sufficient safety) about who I am.

### Trust in others, myself, and systems
Feeling trusted leads to me taking more risks, speaking up, and moving forward. I start with trusting others by default until there is a violation in that trust, which puts everything else on pause for me.

### Safety with a group of other people and to be myself
Everyone is safe to share ideas, express healthy dissent, to challenge the status quo, to be vulnerable, and to not be perfect. I believe that psychological safety in teams, groups, organizations is paramount.

### Fairness for all humans based on compassion, social justice, and empathy
People are treated fairly and the systems for which we interact have fairness and equality in mind.

### Harmony over unneccessary competition or power gradients
I do not value competition, victory over all else, or unhealthy conflict for the sport of it. Harmony does not mean avoiding conflict; I don‚Äôt fear healthy conflict where all work together to become better humans.

### Beauty in nature, humanity, design, and all systems for which we interact
Pausing to take the time to admire the beauty in the world is important to me. I can get cranky when I haven't connected with nature in awhile.

### Spontaneity with purpose
I believe in planning for setting an initial direction, leaving space for learning and iterating as we go. Order for the sense of control does not appeal to me. I think it is important for us to recognize that there are many things not within our control and to let our plans live with that recognition.

### Learning and a growth mindset
Lifelong learning is important to grow and experience life to the fullest. I always look forward to meeting the next version of myself.

## :1st_place_medal: Strengths

### Trust and Safety

I have a strong sensor of reading the mood of the "room" and can adapt to build trust with others and create a safe environment for vulnerability and learning. It can sometimes be overly sensitive (see my _high_ need of Trust in my RMP), but I find that it serves me well regardless.

### Empathy

I can easily empathize and have compassion for others, feel their predicament and am moved to help (either directly or through coaching so that they can help themselves).

### Mindfulness

I strive to always be self-aware, pausing before reacting, and having a deeper understanding of my emotions and triggers. In situations of conflict, I externally express the trigger, reaction, and what I am learning from each experience in order to create a safe space for others to do so as well.

I believe in modeling curiousity, especially in situations where I don't agree or have an initial, negative reaction.

### Curiousity

I have a strong curiousity and desire to learn, whether it is to read something new, try something new, or to learn a process in order to contribute towards making it better.
