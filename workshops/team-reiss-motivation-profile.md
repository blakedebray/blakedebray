# Reiss Motivation Profile (RMP)[^1] Team Workshop

## Purpose

**Personal Discovery -** To facilitate self-empathy and a deeper understanding of our own personal needs that motivates or demotivates us. We can use this self reflection to help us share with others what needs we have and how they can be met.

**Team Development -** To build empathy for each other, providing an understanding of the needs of each individual on the team to know how to better support each other. The team learns how each member does not have the same motivators (helps us be aware of our biases and the stories we tell ourselves of others when they behave differently than us).

## Logistics

- **Duration:** 1.5 hours (minimum); 2 hours (ideal)
- **Tools:** Miro or Figjam (templates coming soon)
- **Additional optional outcomes (post-workshop activities):** Human User Guides for each participant; a list of named "conflicts" and behaviors for navigating them
- **Not included:** actual RMP assessments and results. This is a service that can be provided by a certified RMP master (on my L&D list). Costs can vary.

## Outcomes

- Team members have a deeper understanding of the uniqueness that each member brings.
- Team members have a better understanding of the unique perspectives that other members have; this helps us recognize that our own perspectives are unique, while also realize that it is not the only (right) perspective.
- Team members have a better understanding of how some tasks are motivating for some and demotivating for others.
- Team members have a better understanding of how different motivations and needs can lead to conflict; and having a visual representation of those differences allows the team to name potential conflicts, have a deeper empathy for each others' needs, and de-escalate conflict (without avoiding it).
- Team members can establish working agreements to ensure that all needs are met, increasing the likelihood that all members can be motivated in the work that they do and how they do it.
